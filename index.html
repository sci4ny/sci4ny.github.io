  			<p>Science for New York (Sci4NY) is an initiative that offers support to local policymakers to address technical needs they may face by connecting them with assistance from members of NYC’s vast STEM community.  More broadly, the program aims to build a stronger network between NYC’s political and scientific communities, enhancing science policy-based decision-making to benefit the City’s people and its communities. The main areas of focus are currently:</p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Health & Medicine</li>
  				<li>Climate Change & Energy</li>
 				<li>Big Data</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While the primary focus is on science policy, any project that might benefit from additional technical analysis and/or critical thinking will be considered.  To note, the program’s goal is to provide expertise on matters related to policy, not to make, support or endorse any specific policy and/or policy-related recommendations.</p>
